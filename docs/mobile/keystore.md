# Android App Signing: Keystores and SHA Keys

Before going further, it's **very important** to understand how your app works and how user login happens. Most login problems are due to **setup mistakes**, not issues with the app, website, or admin panel code. To help you **avoid these common problems**, we'll explain the key ideas and the overall login process.

:::caution
Please **read this section carefully**, as it's **essential** for a smooth setup and successful logins.

## Keystore Management and SHA Keys

Knowing about keystores, what kinds there are, how to check which one is being used, how to get SHA keys, and how to create a release keystore is **very important for correct and safe Firebase authentication**.

### What is a Keystore?

    A keystore is a file that safely stores private keys and their public certificates. These keys are needed to **digitally sign your Android app**, which proves it's real and hasn't been changed.

### Types of Keystores

      * **Debug Keystore:** Android Studio **automatically makes this** when you build your app for testing. It's only for **development and testing**.
      * **Release Keystore:** This is a **special keystore you make and manage yourself**. You **must use this** to sign your app before putting it on the Google Play Store. **Never lose your release keystore**, because you'll need it for *all future updates* to your app.

### Checking Which Keystore is Being Used

    When you're developing, your app is usually signed with the debug keystore. For a public release, it **must be signed with your own release keystore**. The signing settings are usually in your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

    You can check this by going to `android/app/build.gradle` and looking for `signingConfig` to see which one is uncommented (doesn't have `//` before the line).

## How to Get SHA Keys

    SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) keys (like SHA-1 and SHA-256) are like unique fingerprints of your signing certificate. Firebase uses these fingerprints to **make sure your app is real and hasn't been tampered with**.

    **Note:** Make sure you can use the `keytool` command in your terminal. If not, there might be an issue with your system's PATH configuration that you'll need to fix.

    To get SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys for your **debug keystore**:

    On macOS/Linux, open your terminal and type:

    ```sh
    keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
    ```

    On Windows, open your command prompt and type:

    ```sh
    keytool -list -v -keystore %USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
    ```

    To get SHA-1 and SHA-256 keys for your **release keystore**:

    **Replace** `your_release_keystore.jks` with the **full path** to your release keystore file and `your_alias_name` with your specific alias.

    ```sh
    keytool -list -v -keystore /path/to/your_release_keystore.jks -alias your_alias_name
    ```

    You will be asked to enter the keystore password.

    You can also use a Gradle command to check. After running your app once, go to the `android` folder of your project in the terminal and run:

    ```sh
    ./gradlew :app:signingReport
    ```

### When and Why You Need SHA Keys

      * **Google Sign-In:** Requires your app’s SHA-1 key to be registered in Firebase.
      * **Phone Auth:** Also depends on correct SHA keys.
      * **Play Store:** After uploading your app, Google Play will sign it with its own key. You **must add the Play Store’s SHA-1 to Firebase** for authentication to work in production.

### How to Create a Release Keystore

    To make a new release keystore, use the `keytool` program. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

    ```sh
    keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore your_release_keystore.jks -alias your_alias_name -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
    ```

      * `your_release_keystore.jks`: This is the name you choose for your keystore file.
      * `your_alias_name`: This is a name for the key pair you're creating.
      * `validity 10000`: This sets how long the certificate is good for in days (like 10,000 days, which is about 27 years).

    During this process, you'll be asked to set a password for the keystore and the key, along with other info like your name, organization, city, state, and country code.
    
    :::danger important
    **It's very important to remember these passwords and keep your keystore file in a very safe place**.
    :::

### How to Use Your Release Keystore

After you've created your release keystore, you need to tell your Android project how to use it.

1. Create a new file named `key.properties` in the **`android` directory** of your project. This file will store your keystore details securely.

2. Add the following lines to your `key.properties` file, replacing the placeholder text with your specific information:

    ```properties
    storePassword=<your-store-password>
    keyPassword=<your-key-password>
    keyAlias=<your-key-alias>
    storeFile=<path-to-your-release-keystore.jks>
    ```

      * `storePassword`: The password you created for your keystore.
      * `keyPassword`: The password you created for the key.
      * `keyAlias`: The alias you gave your key.
      * `storeFile`: The path to your keystore file. You can use a relative path from the `android/app` folder (e.g., `../your_keystore_file.jks`).

3. Next, you need to update your `android/app/build.gradle` file to use this new keystore. Open the file and find the `signingConfigs` section.

4. Change the `signingConfig` to use your release keystore instead of the debug keystore.

```gradle
    android {
        ...
        buildTypes {
            release {
                signingConfig signingConfigs.release
                ...
            }
        }
    ...
    }
```

Now you can proceed to completing the authentication setup with Firebase for your app.
